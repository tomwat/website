<h1>Adding RBAC to Tiller</h1>

<p>In Kubernetes, granting a role to an application-specific service account is a best practice to ensure that your application is operating in the scope that you have specified.  <br>
You can add a service account to Tiller using the --service-account <NAME> flag while you’re configuring Helm. As a prerequisite, you’ll have to create a role binding which specifies a role and a service account name that have been set up in advance. 
</p>

Reference: https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#role-based-access-control <br>
Steps: <br>

Step 2 - Create Tiller service account <br>
