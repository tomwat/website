Because IBM Cloud Private offers role-based access control, you must install a specific version of the Helm CLI client and provide certificates that contain the IBM Cloud Private access token for a specific account. <br>
<br>
Step 0 - Remove Helm from your Linux client if already installed <br> 
Step 1 - Install the correct Helm version by using the Web GUI  <br>
Step 2 - Initialize the Helm client <br>
Step 3 - Download ICP certificate/key required to do TLS/SSL <br>

Interesting thing here is I already have Helm for pushing my website to IKS - IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.  This means I also have an existing HELM_HOME - /home/tomwat/.helm <br>
This is not going to work since I now have ICP Kubernetes that I will be helming to <br>
So, I now have different config files "icp.sh" and "iks.sh" that will set HELM_HOME to either .helm-iks or .helm-icp <br>
To remove helm, just remove the existing /usr/local/bin/helm binary.
</p>

<p>
Step 1 - Install the correct Helm version by using the Web GUI <br>
<br>
Helm client and server versions must be the same in ICP, probably in IKS also <br>
From the ICP GUI: <br>
$ curl -kLo helm-linux-amd64-v2.9.1.tar.gz https://169.61.52.138:8443/api/cli/helm-linux-amd64.tar.gz <br>
extract the helm binary and cp it to /usr/local/bin/helm <br>
<br>
Notice "error - cannot connect to Tiller"
</p>

<p>
Step 2 - Initialize the Helm client <br>
<br>  
Set the HELM_HOME on command line and in icp.sh profile <br>
$ helm init --client-only
</p>

<p>
Step 3 - Download ICP certificate/key required to do Helm-to-Tiller TLS/SSL <br>
<br>
By logging into ICP as the admin user, $HELM_HOME is automatically populated with the certificates and keys required <br>
<br>
$ helm version --tls <br>
Now shows matching client and Tiller versions
