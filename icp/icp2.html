<h1>IBM Cloud Private - Namespace considerations </h1>

<p>Namespaces in ICP require a bit more consideration than pure Kubernetes</p>

<p>
Note - ICP 311 has rigorous security.  When you create your namespace, the pod security <br>
policy will need to be defined.  Also, there is an Image Policy....see ICP Namespaces. <br>
Originally, I was only able to deploy this in default namespace.

<p> Another interesting thing about images...when you tag the image with <br>
the image for ICP, it does not delete the previous, it just makes this new <br>
one the "latest" tag <br>  
Remember to clean up your images once in awhile. <br>
