<h1>IBM Cloud Private - Install on IBM Cloud Vms </h1>

<p>
Dave Krier ICP 311 instructions: <br>
https://ibm-icp-coc.github.io/ICP-311-Install/
</p>

<p>
Notes: <br>
1. I went with 1 master node and 1 worker node.  Each configured as 8vcpu and 32gb RAM.  <br>
2. take your time and switch back and forth between master and worker config.  I got into some kind of ssh issue because I went too fast <br>
</p>

<p>
Set my Kuberntes client to IBM Cloud Private kubernetes config: <br>
<br>
Go to the ICP GUI, and select "Configure Client" <br>
On your client, run the script "set-icp-client.sh" in my HOME dir
