<h1>MySkills website - the entire flow</h1>

<p>
High Level: <br>
1. On my Developer workstation, I make a change to my website <br>
2. I test the change locally on my workstation <br>
3. I commit the change to my local git repo <br>
4. I push the change to my remote repo - github.com <br>
5. Jenkins is configured to listen for changes in my github repository <br>
6. Jenkins initiates a build process - see below <br>
7. At the end of the build process, a new website has been deployed to IBM Cloud
</p>
<p>
The build process: <br>

The Jekinsfile will perform these 4 stages of build process: <br>
(i)  Build the Docker image when code is committed to GitHub. <br>
(ii) Push the Docker image to the IBM Cloud Private Container registry. <br>
(iii)Perform unit testing with container structure test framework. <br>
(iv) Perform an upgrade of the Helm chart.  <br>
